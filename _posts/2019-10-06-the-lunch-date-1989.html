My seventh grade science teacher had an obsession with the skill of observation. She had the class watch the following short film, intermittently pausing to ask us about small details. 

<p>I was reminded of the film due to recent events. I recall reacting to it in a way opposite to how I reacted to <i>1984</i>, which I read around the same time, and of which I was skeptical due to its confidence in the hapless frailty of men. This film is not much more optimistic, but somehow I found it more convincing.
