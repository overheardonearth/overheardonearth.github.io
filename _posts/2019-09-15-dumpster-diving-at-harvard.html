By the conventional wisdom, people arrive at Ivy Leagues with a hint of entitlement and leave with the stench of elitism. On the other hand, I learned to dumpster dive. It's not entirely clear why I turned out the way I did, but there is a simple logic to it: The young and rich are very willing to discard.

<p>
I arrived where I am presently under particular circumstances. First, I'd chosen a cheap studio in the midst of the undergraduate sector of the university - prime real estate for picking up after young extravagance. Second, I have a semester off from teaching: no running into students. Accordingly, not a soul this side of the campus, other than my landlord, knows of my existence. I do have some pride, but under the guise of anonymity, I become very bold.

<p>
When I first arrived at my new studio, I didn't have a lightbulb, and the ceiling light was broken. There was no furniture; I sat on the ground and worked by the light of the stove vent. I've collected a nice little set of furniture since then. I'm so proud of it I thought I'd share a photograph. I didn't pay for anything visible in the image, other than the blue blanket and mattress:

In fact, it might be fun to create a running list of what undergradates happily throw away:

<ul>
  <li> Standing lamp
  <li> Vacuum cleaner
  <li> Microwave
  <li> Minichest
  <li> Plastic storage tub
  <li> Bicycle
  <li> Square folding table
  <li> Mattress frame
  <li> A nice set of five water glasses
  <li> Cutting board
  <li> Rolling cart
  <li> Ikea coffee table
  <li> Another standing lamp
  <li> One kitchen chair
  <li> Two desk chairs
</ul>

There were a few things I got for free through other means:

<ul>
  <li> Three fluffy blankets
  <li> Bed sheets
  <li> Shower curtain
  <li> Mattress pad
  <li> Tablecloth
</ul>

Strangely enough, the one thing I was unable to find, and could use: clothes hangers.
