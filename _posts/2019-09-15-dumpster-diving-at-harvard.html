I don't know why I turned out the way I did. By the conventional wisdom, people arrive at Ivy Leagues with a hint of entitlement and leave with the stench of elitism. On the other hand, I learned to dumpster dive. There is a simple logic to it: The young and rich are very willing to discard functional goods.

I arrived where I am presently under very particular circumstances. First, I'd chosen a cheap studio in the midst of the undergraduate sector of the university - prime real estate for picking up after young extravagance. Second, I have a semester off from teaching: no running into students. Accordingly, not a soul this side of the campus, other than my landlord, knows of my existence. I do have some pride, but under the guise of anonymity, I become very bold.

When I first arrived at my new studio, I didn't have a lightbulb, and the ceiling light was broken. There was no furniture; I sat on the ground and worked by the light of the stove vent. I've collected a nice little set of furniture since then. I'm so proud of it I thought I'd share a photograph. I didn't pay for anything visible in the image, other than the blue blanket and mattress:
