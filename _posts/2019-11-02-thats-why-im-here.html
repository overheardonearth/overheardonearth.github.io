The following is a clip of one of Karen Chee's standup routines about Darwin's fox. I love the way she ends it. It hits me in a visceral way; revealing this is surely an invitation for psychoanalysis (of me, not her; I'm aware that it's just a joke to her). Unfortunately I can't quite put my finger on what I am reminded of, and so I keep watching it:


<div class="media"><div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/6epxj/totqm" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div></div>
