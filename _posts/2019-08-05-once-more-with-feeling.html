I took piano lessons for multiple years. I had two teachers; I refer to them as my German and French piano teachers, respectively. Both were were Chinese; they studied music in Europe.

<p>
My German teacher was the better pianist. I don't recall her ever missing a note. She always played beautifully. My sister, always the feminist, wondered why she didn't become a concert pianist.

<p>
My French teacher was the more effusive artist. She taught music, not piano. I learned a lot from her, though she didn't know this - I was a terrible student. I in particular remember at least a couple of times when the following occurred:
  
<div class="media">
  I would play some passage, and she would stop me - "No, no, no! You cannot play it like THAT!" She would proceed to either sing how the passage should be played, "da-da-DA-DEE-dum," or play the passage herself. But I was a bit older when I was her student, and the pieces were not trivial to sightread. She would be spotty with fingerfaults. It was difficult to sort out what she was getting at.
  
 <p> Nervous and not sure what to fix, I would just play the passage again, once more, exactly the same way. She would exclaim, "Yes, yes, MUCH better!"
    
</div>

Of course, it's clear what she meant. I imagine that in her head she had something beautiful in mind, like the following clip. Wait for the repeat in the solo, and listen carefully for the change:
