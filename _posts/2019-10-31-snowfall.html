Today was the first real snowfall of the year. It snowed a little two days ago but it was light and brief, sticking only a little. It's cold - not colder than I remember it but I thought it would be better, being better equipped now.

I recall my first real experience with snow - living in it, rather than going to it. I had to catch a train to get to the airport, and by the tracks, there were express trains that did not stop. It was an experience to see it. The terminology that comes to mind is that it was like watching a force of nature, but of course it was precisely the opposite.

Hummingbirds are of course known for hovering; lesser known is the fact that they hover out of necessity. They can’t walk because their legs are placed too far back on their bodies. They have to fly for food. Their hearts beat faster than those of most creatures, at more than 1,200 beats per minute during flight. They live shorter lives, on average, than other birds. Five years is ancient for a hummingbird, compared to, say, ten for a crow. They often simply wear themselves out—die from a lack of food or warmth in the winter, starved for energy. They need so much to keep going.
