title: Let Them Have Coffee
---

I sometimes say that my instinct for frugality is congenital. I often believe this, but if I deliberate over my past, I can recall some potential influences.

<p>
  For instance, when I was young, I read and much admired <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i> by Betty Smith - the initial chapters in particular, which quietly discuss the means by which a young family survived in early 20th century New York on pennies and nickels, and rarely dimes. To this day it is the story I associate with economy. I dislike that other pieces on personal finance are typically contaminated with connotations of poverty or sport; <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i> is simply about getting by with little.

<p>
The following passage is one of my favorite references to embed in conversation (admittedly, I have many). Francie, the protagonist, is a young girl at the time.

<div class="media">
Neeley and Francie loved coffee but seldom drank it. Today, as usual, Neeley let his coffee stand black and ate his condensed milk spread on bread. He sipped a little of the black coffee for the sake of formality. Mama poured out Francie's coffee and put the milk in it even though she knew that the child wouldn't drink it. 

<p>
Francie loved the smell of coffee and the way it was hot. As she ate her bread and meat, she kept one hand curved about the cup enjoying its warmth. From time to time, she'd smell the bitter sweetness of it. That was better than drinking it. At the end of the meal, it went down the sink. 

<p>
Mama had two sisters, Sissy and Evy, who came to the flat often. Every time they saw the coffee thrown away, they gave mama a lecture about wasting things. 

<p>
Mama explained: "Francie is entitled to one cup each meal like the rest. If it makes her feel better to throw it way rather than to drink it, all right. I think it's good that people like us can waste something once in a while and get the feeling of how it would be to have lots of money and not have to worry about scrounging."

  Edit: I discovered after the fact that this post was surprisingly apt given the recent <a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/6/11/18661768/suze-orman-coffee-latte-myth-millennial-personal-finance-tips">vitriol</a> over <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/07/coffee-financial-advice/594244/">buying coffee</a>. 
  <p>
I am not (heavy-handedly) condoning millennial coffee drinking. The above passage is about a simpler time. Then capitalism discovered the delightful combination of pricing power and the ease with which one takes money from young people.
