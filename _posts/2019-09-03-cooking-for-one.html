When Hye-won of <i>Little Forest </i> leaves the city to return to her provincial hometown, she meets her friend, who asks about her return:

<div class="media">
"But why did you come back? Did you pass your exams? Why didn't you call me first? Did your boyfriend pass?"

<p>
"Ah...well..."

  <p>
Some friends hit you where it hurts. Eun-Sook is like that.

<p>
"I get it. You failed and he passed, huh? You were embarrassed and came back to hide? You did that before too, when you did bad on your tests. You kept it to yourself. That's why you came, right?"

<p>
"That's not it. I came because I'm hungry."

<p>
"Not because you're jealous?"

<p>
"I'm really hungry."
  
<p>
"Mm. Hey should we call Jae-ha over?"
  
  <p>
  "Jae-ha? How long has he been back?"
    
    <p>
      Jae-ha went to a nearby university and got a job right away. Since I went to school in Seoul, we naturally lost touch. He helped his parents farm and started a small orchard.

        Eun-Sook graduated from college and got a job at the bank in town. Since she's never lived away from home, she complains how boring it is here. Her dream is to escape and live in the city. 
        
        <p>
          I worked part-time and studied for the teacher certification exam. But My life in Seoul was stifling. Instant food wasn't filling. I meant it when I said I came back because I'm hungry.
