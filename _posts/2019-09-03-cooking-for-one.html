When Hye-won of <i>Little Forest</i> leaves the city to return to her provincial hometown, she meets her friend, who asks about her return. The conversation and narration captures essentially the entirely of the film's narrative.

"But why did you come back? Did you pass your exams? Why didn't you call me first? Did your boyfriend pass?"

<p>
"Ah...well..."

Some friends hit you where it hurts. Eun-Sook is like that.

<p>
"I get it. You failed and he passed, huh? You were embarrassed and came back to hide? You did that before too, when you did bad on your tests. You kept it to yourself. That's why you came, right?"

<p>
"That's not it. I came because I'm hungry."

<p>
"Not because you're jealous?"

<p>
"I'm really hungry."
