I overheard on the street where I live (a bit of an undergraduate frat district), two girls who incidentally seemed quite sober:

<div class="media">
Girl 1: Does puking make you undrunk?
</div>

In passing, I didn't hear what Girl 2 had to say, but it's a good question. I had to look up the answer, which is no.
