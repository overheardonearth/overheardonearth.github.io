This post is an indulgence. I try to only reveal myself cryptically through the content of what I observe about others. Today I will be uninspired.

I came home after college. Many things had changed; this was not unexpected, especially after some reflection. But some changes were real phenomena, the more I thought about them. 

<p>
The greatest change revealed itself timidly. It was in my head, I thought at first. It was this: I no longer felt entirely safe while being driven by my parents.

<p>
The safety of my parent's driving had been to me an undisputed reality - like the style of my mom's cooking. It simply was. It wasn't that I had become a superior driver in my time away. I hardly even sat in a car during college. (At first I thought it was the use of a car, not my parent's driving, that unsettled me when I returned to the suburbs.)

<p>
Little things revealed themselves to me over time. Setting up the new TV, not understanding the instruction manual. Blank pauses when listening to waiters at American restaurants. Reviewing mistakes during tax season.

<p>
There was a time when the relationship between my parents and I was one of unilateral reliance. I understand that in large part, a proper communication of this statement necessitates quantiative qualifiers: Individuals are rarely uniform assets or liabilities. But what I'm trying to say now is that in some other significant aspect, the moment of qualitative change lights some sort of a candle, or perhaps rather puts one out.
