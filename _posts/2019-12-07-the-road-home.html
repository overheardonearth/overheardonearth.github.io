I observed some time ago that a number of people name <i>In the Mood for Love</i> as their favorite film. I always found this perplexing. I'd found the film interesting but heavy-handed, the artistry of the film disproprotionate to its content.

<p>
More recently I realized a theory, a reason for the film's popularity: There is no alternative. Search for top ten lists of romance films, look for unthemed romances with a tragic slant, and the sparsity becomes clear.

<p>
Just now I watched <i>The Road Home</i> (1999) and not having written in a while, and with some lingering sentiment, I came to recommend it. I must be getting old; simple, nearly plotless stories quickly find their way onto my personal list.

Unfortunately the film does not have, to my mind, standalone clips that carry their own weight; it is one of the few films I find appealing only in its entirety. I do however, recommend its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0gP0mOoa60>soundtrack</a>.
