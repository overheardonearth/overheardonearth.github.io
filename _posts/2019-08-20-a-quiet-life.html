I recently moved and am living alone after a long stretch of living with others. In many respects I am living alone for the first time.

<p>
  Earlier today I took a moment to watch <i>Little Forest</i> (2018), for one reason or another - opportunistically, rather than intentionally. I enjoyed it quite a bit - a little too much. I am not sure I would have reacted as positively had I encountered it at any other point in my life. Watching it requires a certain patience - difficult when with others, but which comes easily when alone.
