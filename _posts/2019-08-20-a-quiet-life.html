I recently moved and am living alone after a long stretch of living with others. In many respects I will be living alone for the first time.

<p>
Earlier today I took a moment to watch <i>Little Forest (2018)</i>, for one reason or another - opportunistically, rather than intentionally. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I am not sure I would have reacted as positively had I watched it at any other point in my life. Watching it requires a certain patience - difficult when with others, but which comes easily when alone.
