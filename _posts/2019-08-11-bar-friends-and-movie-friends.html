I listened to the Moth Radio Hour a while back. There are gems. I recall one well-told story by a man who volunteered at a suicide hotline. 

The story focused on one caller. One call, to be precise. She seemed simply to want to talk for a bit, and they did:

<div class="media">She said she had two types of friends, which I thought was really funny. She had bar friends and then she had movie friends. I like that expression. I wish I had some movie friends, but so be it. She could have been a movie friend if I had met her in some other situation.</div>

That expression caught my attention too. This story has become another one of my favorite references, due to that expression. But I suspect its attraction is not due to the literal interpretation as used in the Moth story, but that it has the potential to capture some subtleties about the nature of friendship.

<p>
Recently I have decided that bar friends deserve the complimentary side of the expression. Movie friends are those who like the same movies as you; those who understand your work, play the same sports as you, and enjoy the same restaurants - the most logical of friendships.

    A bar friend is a friend satisfying none of these properties.
