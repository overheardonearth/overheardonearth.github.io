I listened to the Moth Radio Hour a while back. There are gems. I recall one well-told story about working for a suicide hotline. 

The story focused around one caller. She seemed simply to want to talk for a bit, and they did:

<div class="media">She said she had two types of friends, which I thought was really funny. She had bar friends and then she had movie friends. I like that expression. I wish I had some movie friends, but so be it. She could have been a movie friend if I had met her in some other situation.</div>

I liked that expression too. It has become another one of my favorite references. 

But there is something I have to get off my chest: The expression was not explained in the Moth story, and I suspect it was ill-defined. I admit to using it a few times in the way that the storyteller used it, which as I understand it, essentially condescends the act of getting wasted. But this usage is too simplistic and doesn't employ the full gamut of the expression.

<p>
Recently I started reversing the figure of speech. I don't drink, but I have decided that bar friends should earn the compliment. Movie friends are those who like the same movies as you; those who understand your work, play the same sports as you, and enjoy the same restaurants. A bar friend satisfies none of these properties - but is a friend nonetheless.
