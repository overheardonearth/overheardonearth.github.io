Consider the following clip. The guy on the right, Graham, is the interviewer; he has a personal finance channel on Youtube.
<div class="media">
<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/ysmow/yovze" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
</div>
The interviewee exhibits his message masterfully, as though with a magician's misdirection. As for Graham, I understand he was trying to be friendly - he normally doesn't do interviews - but this clip was a bit irresponsible.

<p>
Basic investment considerations:

<ul>
<li> Liquidity: You can sell an ETF or stock in a fraction of a second during trading hours, with essentially no fees or negligible fees. This not the case for a vintage handbag.
<li> Transparency: Furthermore, when you sell your ETF or stock, you can be reasonably certain that you've sold it for a fair price, because of the established exchanges and high volumes. The interviewee in fact <i>emphasizes</i> that there is no established exchange or reasonable volume for designer handbags, so quoted prices are spurious at best.
<li> Volatility: The interviewee talks about the designer handbags as though they appreciate 14% every year, consistently. This is doubtful. I can't be any more precise than "doubtful," because of the previous point.
  <li> Price manipulation: The interviewee discusses this as though it's a good thing.
  <li> Diversification: Altria (America's primary tobacco company) also grew roughly 14% from 1980 to now, even despite its recent downturn. I doubt Graham would advise anyone of normal means to drop 100k into Altria stock.
</ul>
I don't oppose buying a handbag if it aligns with your desires; I'd happily burn my money on a Steinway. I don't like that he pretends to have bought it as a wise investment.
