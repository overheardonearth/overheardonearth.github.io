I came home after college. Many things had changed. This was not unexpected, but some changes were real phenomena. The greatest change revealed itself timidly. It was in my mind, I thought at first; the hint of unease I felt when being driven by my parents.

<p>
The safety of my parent's driving had been to me an undisputed reality - like the style of my mom's cooking. It simply was. It wasn't that I had become a superior driver in my time away. I hardly even sat in a car during college. (At first I thought it was the use of a car, not my parent's driving, that unsettled me when I returned to the suburbs.)

<p>
Little things revealed themselves to me over time. Blank pauses when listening to waiters at American restaurants. Reviewing mistakes during tax season. Doctor's visits.

<p>
There was a time when the relationship between my parents and I was one of unilateral reliance. I understand that in large part, a proper communication of this claim necessitates quantiative qualifiers: Individuals are rarely uniform assets or liabilities. But what I am wanting to say now is that in some other significant regard, the moment of qualitative change alone, extinguishes some sort of a light - one I was not even aware was lit.
