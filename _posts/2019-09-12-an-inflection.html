I came home after college. Many things had changed. This was not unexpected, but some changes were real phenomena. The greatest change revealed itself timidly. It was in my mind, I thought at first; the hint of unease I felt, being a passenger in my parents' car.

<p>
Little things revealed themselves to me over time. Blank pauses when listening to waiters at American restaurants. Reviewing mistakes during tax season. Doctor's visits.

<p>
There was a time when the relationship between my parents and I was one of unilateral reliance. I understand that in large part, a proper communication of this claim necessitates quantiative qualifiers: Individuals are rarely uniform assets or liabilities. But what I am wanting to say now is that in some other significant regard, the moment of qualitative change alone, extinguishes a light, of which until then, I was not even aware.
