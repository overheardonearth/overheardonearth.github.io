One evening I heard on the radio a story about the following letter by Walt Whitman, and I remembered it just now when thinking about the tone I would like to set.

<p>
    According to lore Whitman volunteered for a time in field hospitals during the Civil War. He would bring fruit and candy, as well as pen and paper, to scribe letters for the wounded and dying. There is little record of such taking place, however. Only recently was the following letter discovered.

    My Dear Wife,
    <br><br>

    You must excuse me for not having written to you before. I have not been very well and did not feel much like writing – but I feel considerably better now – my complaint is an affection of the lungs. I am mustered out of service, but am not at present well enough to come home. I hope you will try to write back as soon as you receive this and let me know how you all are, how things are going on – let me know how it is with mother. I write this by means of a friend who is now sitting by my side and I hope it will be God's will that we shall yet meet again. Well I send you all my love and must now close.

    <br><br>
    Your affectionate husband,<br>
    Nelson Jabo
