In high school biology they discuss the punctuated equilibrium model of evolution: that evolution happens mostly in brief spurts through moments of ecological stress, and in particular is difficult to observe in real time. I don't remember the current consensus on the model's basis in reality, but in any case I am reminded of it now in another context. I heard recently on the radio someone describe what I am tempted to refer to as the punctuated equilibrium model of memories.

<p>
  The following are two punctuations of my own. They are entirely uninteresting, but factually, are embedded deeply in my own store of memories; and I feel that there is some soliton of a concept or emotion wanting to form. 

<p>---

<p> In fifth grade our two teachers were having us watch a Mary Poppins film. I was unfamiliar with the cultural phenomenon altogether. This was likely fortunate for me, as I will explain.
  
<p> I was not paying attention to the other students, but I would later deduce the following. A small group of girls was talking among themselves publicly enough to let on to an active observer that they were not impressed. I speculate that they were familiar with Mary Poppins and viewed it as a film for younger children. The teachers caught on to this, and interrupted the film, deciding to make a lesson out of it. 
    
<p> They were nervous, like persons under attack, and began by introducing to us a new word: supercilious. There was some discussion following, about the reasons one would watch a film for an age demographic below one's own. Their reasons were very literal and not very convincing - the takeaway I recall is that one day we would have and interact with children of our own. But even if they were unable to compose in words or logic their disappointment, I think we understood. We resumed the film, and I recall uncomfortable canned laughter for the remaining runtime.
  
<p> With respect to EQ, I started with little and learned slowly. But I was fortunate enough to be a quiet child so as to learn more often from the embarrassment of others than my own. I don't think I've ever used or heard the word "supercilious" since, but that one incident was enough to establish it henceforth as a landmine of a social crime.
  
<p>---
  
<p> The next story is about the first time I understood <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, some six years later; I was (am) young for my age, and when I'd read it, perhaps two years earlier in turn, I was still in the rye myself.
