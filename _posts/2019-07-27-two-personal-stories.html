In high school biology they discuss the punctuated equilibrium model of evolution: that evolution happens mostly in brief spurts through moments of ecological stress, and in particular is difficult to observe in real time. I don't remember the current consensus on the model's basis in reality, but in any case I am reminded of it now in another context. I heard recently on the radio someone describe what I am tempted to refer to as the punctuated equilibrium model of memories.

<p>
  The following are two punctuations of my own. They are essentially uninteresting, but are embedded deeply in my own store of memories, factually; and I feel that there is some soliton of a concept or emotion wanting to form. 

<p>---

<p> In fifth grade our two teachers were having us watch a Mary Poppins film. I was unfamiliar with the character and the cultural phenomenon altogether. This was perhaps fortunate for me, as I will explain.
  
<p> I was not paying attention to the other students, but I would later deduce the following. A small group of girls was talking among themselves, quietly enough that I was unaware; but publicly enough to let on to an active observer that they were bored. I speculate that they were familiar with Mary Poppins and viewed it as a film for younger children. The teachers caught on to this, and interrupted the film, deciding to make a lesson out of it. 
    
<p> With a nervousness characteristic of persons under attack, they introduced to us a new word: supercilious. There was some discussion following, about the reasons one would watch a film for an age demographic below one's own. Their reasons were very literal and not very convincing - something about one day having children. But it was clear that they were unhappy, and fifth graders are still at an age lacking in independence, the only avenue for promotion being the approval of their superiors. We resumed the film, and I recall uncomfortable canned laughter for the remaining runtime.
  
<p> Shame is instructive: I don't think I've ever used or heard the word "supercilious" since, but in my life it has become a landmine of a concept - among the greatest of social crimes. 
  
<p>---
  
<p> The next story is about the first time I understood <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, some six years later; I was (am) young for my age, and when I'd read it, perhaps two years earlier in turn, I was still in the rye myself.
