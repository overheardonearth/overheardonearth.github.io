<p>
Welcome!
</p>

<p>
I am a recent PhD in a pure mathematics. However, I am also interested in impure mathematics.
</p>

<p>
I plan for this website to be an educational experience for me (and hopefully you) in web programming, web design, data visualization, data analysis, and mathematics education, through interactive diagrams and graphs. Topics I hope to eventually discuss include finance, science, and music.

  Comments or complaints? I'd be happy to make a Part II to any of my posts with additional data or media if you have suggestions. Email me at github "dot" datainteractive at gmail, or comment below.
